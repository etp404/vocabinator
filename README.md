The idea of this app is to replace a google drive document that I'm using currently. When I come across a French word that I don't know when reading, or one that I need when writing or talking, I add it to a drive document, which I periodically sit and test myself on. I'd like to be able to add words to a personal dictionary quickly and easily, and generate quizzes in a convenient way for when I've got a spare five minutes here and there.

The first pass will just take a french word, but then I'll support both directions. If I'm finding it useful I'll extend it to include other languages, which should be relatively straightforward. 

I'm backing it with this API: https://glosbe.com/a-api.

Todo list
In core I have some JSON files for tests. The only way I could get tests to find them was to put them in production resources. I'm fairly sure there's a solution to this, but wanted to move on for now.
